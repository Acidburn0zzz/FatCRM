Here is a quick description about how to use SugarClient.
We are still in the implementation stage and the step described 
below will most probably change during the development process.

When using the Windows installer, just click the SugarClient item in Windows
start menu, Folder "FatCRM" and skip to (3).
When running for the first time, check Appendix (B).

1/ Best way is to start the akonadi controller from its own terminal.
====================================================================
Open a shell. and run: 
'akonadictl start' ( to stop run 'akonadictl stop' ).


2/ Start the SugarClient from another shell by running:
======================================================
'sugarclient'

If you did not start akonadictl as recommended in 1 - sugarclient will start it by itself. Or you can even login for its File menu.

Akonadictl being started, the treeviews for the different modules 
supported at the moment should be dilled up with data.

N.B: The following description is the same for all the supported types 
of items  ( Accounts, Opportunities, Leads, Contacts, Campaign ).

3/ Show the data ( details) for an item.
=======================================

- Double click on it 
- Select it and check the Show Details CheckBox.
- Run (View -> <Type Details> or Alt-V - A (e.g for Accounts )

The detail widget should be displayed as a DockWidget.
Check the Detach check box to have it in a floating state. Or uncheck it 
to have it back docked.

4/ Modify data
==============

- Modify any data displayed ( details widget ), that should enable the 
Save button at the bootm of the detail widget.
- Click on Save. The widget is disabled until the cache and the model (local) 
have been updated. If you are in a connected state ( remote server ) you can 
see the Date Modified and by label top of the details widget being updated when the data returns back ( after an automated sync  ) 

N.B: it is also possible to run:
 File -> Synchroize ( Alt-F - S ) 
 or click on the reload icone top right of the details widget to force a Sync.

5/ Add New Data (items)
=======================

- Click on the New button at the top left of each page (tab widgets)
  or run 'Alt-N'

The details widget will reset itself and clear all its fields 
(if it was already diplayed ) or will be displayed empty.

- Add the data you want to register. This will enable the save button

-Click on Save. The widget is disabled until the cache and the model (local) 
have been updated. If you are in a connected state ( remote server ) you can 
see the Date Modified and by label top of the details widget being updated when the data returns back ( after an automated sync  )  

6/ Remove an item
=================

- Select the item you want to remove 
- Click on the Remove button or run Alt-R
- A dialog is displayed asking for confirmation.
- Click Yes 

The item is permanentely removed.

7/ Search an item 
=================

N.B: The search function is taking in account any text displayed in any column 
for the page you are searching.

- Click your search string in the search edit field.
- The model will only show the items related to your search string.
- reset by clearing the search field ( Clear button on its right side )
 
 
Appendix (A): File Menu
=======================
File -> Login: 
- Switches which resource's data is being shown in the client.
- If the resource is in "Offline" mode, it will be switched to "Online",
  meaning it will attempt to login to the server and synchronize data.

File -> Logout: 

- Switches the resource who's data is currently worked on into "Offline"
  mode. It will logout from the server and stop synchronizing data.

File -> Synchronize 
- Force a sync, instead of waiting for the next automated one.

File -> Reload: 
- Locallly reload the data, i.e. refresh the view's from data cached in
  Akonadi. No interaction with the server.


Appendix (B) Settings Menu
==========================

Settings -> Configure CRM Accounts... 

- Let you Add new resources.
- Configure the existing resource.
- Remove existing resources.

This dialog will also show the state of each resource, e.g. whether they are
online/offline, if they've reported an error, etc.

1) Configuration SugarCRM resources
-----------------------------------

SugarCRM resources need three configuration values:
- host URL: this can be copy&paste from a browser which is logged in using
  the CMR's web interface. Usually something like http://host/crm/index.php

- user name
- user password. The password is only displayed in clear text during input.
