Resource:
=========

Uses SOAP to talk to the Sugar web service.

Loads the data into value classes provided by the lib kdcrmdata (SugarAccount, SugarOpportunity), and KABC::Addressee for contacts.

This is then serialized into XML, and stored it in Akonadi items.

Sugar Client:
=============

Fetches the right collection for each type of object.

Lists the collection (via the ETM).

For each Akonadi item, extracts the SugarAccount, SugarOpportunity etc. by deserializing the XML.

The GUI uses a generic QMap<QString, QString> to get/set data in these objects.

One problem with this is, when creating a new object, how to know which keys should be filled.
Current solution: remember keys from previous already-existing objects.
Idea for a better solution: a static method in the kdcrmdata classes, fits well with the new static Hash some have.
